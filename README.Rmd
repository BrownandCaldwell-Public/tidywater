## Overview 

Tidywater incorporates published water chemistry and empirical models in a standard format.
The modular functions allow for building custom, comprehensive drinking water treatment processes. 
Functions are designed to work in a [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) workflow. 

## Installation


``` r
# Install tidywater from CRAN:
install.packages("tidywater")

# Alternatively, install the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BrownandCaldwell-Public/tidywater")
```

## Examples

In this first example, acid-base chemistry and TOC removal models are demonstrated. This example 
uses tidywater base functions to model a single water quality scenario.

```{r example, message = FALSE, setup = TRUE}
library(tidywater)
library(tidyverse)
## Use base tidywater functions to model water quality for a single scenario.
base_coagulation <- define_water(ph = 8, alk = 90, tds = 50, toc = 3, doc = 2.8, uv254 = 0.08) %>%
  chemdose_ph(alum = 30) %>%
  chemdose_toc(alum = 30)
```

To model multiple water quality scenarios, use `_df` helper functions to 
apply the models to a dataframe.

```{r}
## x_df functions apply models to a list of "waters", and output a list of "waters" so that
## the data can be piped into the next tidywater model.
coagulation <- water_df %>%
  define_water_df(output_water = "raw") %>%
  mutate(alum = 30) %>%
  chemdose_ph_df(input_water = "raw", output_water = "phchange") %>%
  # To get relevant parameters as separate columns, use pluck_cols argument
  chemdose_toc_df(input_water = "phchange", output_water = "coag", pluck_cols = TRUE)

## To get out other individual parameters, use `pluck_water`
coagulation <- coagulation %>%
  pluck_water(input_waters = c("raw", "coag"), parameter = c("hco3", "co3"))
```

Note that these functions use a "water" class. The "water" class is the foundation of the package; 
it provides a mechanism for linking models in any order while maintaining water quality information.
The `define_water` function takes water quality inputs, but `define_water_df` may be used to convert
a dataframe to a list of "waters".

For more detailed examples on tidywater functions and how to use "water" class data, please see
