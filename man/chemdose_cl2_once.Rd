\title{Apply `chemdose_cl2`function within a data frame and output a data frame}
\usage{
chemdose_cl2_once(
  df,
  input_water = "defined_water",
  cl2 = 0,
  time = 0,
  treatment = "raw",
  cl_type = "chlorine"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data frame containing a water class column, which has already been computed using
\code{\link{define_water_once}}. The df may include a column named for the applied chlorine dose (cl2),
and a column for time.}

\item{input_water}{name of the column of water class data to be used as the input for this function. Default is "defined_water".}

\item{cl2}{Applied chlorine or chloramine dose (mg/L as cl2). Model results are valid for doses between 0.995 and 41.7 mg/L for raw water,
and for doses between 1.11 and 24.7 mg/L for coagulated water.}

\item{time}{Reaction time (hours). Chlorine decay model results are valid for reaction times between 0.25 and 120 hours.Chloramine decay model
does not have specified boundary conditions.}

\item{treatment}{Type of treatment applied to the water. Options include "raw" for no treatment (default), "coag" for
water that has been coagulated or softened.}

\item{cl_type}{Type of chlorination applied, either "chlorine" (default) or "chloramine".}
}
\value{
A data frame with updated chlorine residuals.
}
\description{
This function allows \code{\link{chemdose_cl2}} to be added to a piped data frame.
Its output is a data frame containing columns for total OCl or NH2Cl (depending on chlorine type).
}
\details{
The data input comes from a `water` class column, as initialized in \code{\link{define_water}}.

If the input data frame has a chlorine dose column (cl2) or time column (time), the function will use those columns. Note:
The function can only take cl2 and time inputs as EITHER a column or from the function arguments, not both.

tidywater functions cannot be added after this function because they require a `water` class input.

For large datasets, using `fn_once` or `fn_chain` may take many minutes to run. These types of functions use the furrr package
for the option to use parallel processing and speed things up. To initialize parallel processing, use
`plan(multisession)` or `plan(multicore)` (depending on your operating system) prior to your piped code with the
`fn_once` or `fn_chain` functions. Note, parallel processing is best used when your code block takes more than a minute to run,
shorter run times will not benefit from parallel processing.
