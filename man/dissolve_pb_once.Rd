\title{Apply `dissolve_pb` to a dataframe and create a new column with numeric dose}
\usage{
dissolve_pb_once(
  df,
  input_water = "defined_water",
  output_water = "tot_dissolved_pb",
  hydroxypyromorphite = "Schock",
  pyromorphite = "Topolska",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data frame containing a column, defined_water, which has already
been computed using \code{\link{define_water}}, and a column named for each of the chemicals being dosed}

\item{input_water}{name of the column of water class data to be used as the input. Default is "defined_water".}

\item{output_water}{name of the output column storing dissolved lead in M. Default is "tot_dissolved_pb".}

\item{hydroxypyromorphite}{defaults to "Schock", the constant, K, developed by Schock et al (1996). Can also use "Zhu".}

\item{pyromorphite}{defaults to "Topolska", the constant, K, developed by Topolska et al (2016). Can also use "Xie".}

\item{laurionite}{defaults to "Nasanen", the constant, K, developed by Nasanen & Lindell (1976). Can also use "Lothenbach".}

\description{
This function allows \code{\link{dissolve_pb}} to be added to a piped data frame.
Its output is a the name of the controlling lead solid, and total dissolved lead (M).
}
\details{
The data input comes from a `water` class column, initialized in \code{\link{define_water}} or \code{\link{balance_ions}}.


 For large datasets, using `fn_once` or `fn_chain` may take many minutes to run. These types of functions use the furrr package
 for the option to use parallel processing and speed things up. To initialize parallel processing, use
 `plan(multisession)` or `plan(multicore)` (depending on your operating system) prior to your piped code with the
 `fn_once` or `fn_chain` functions. Note, parallel processing is best used when your code block takes more than a minute to run,
 shorter run times will not benefit from parallel processing.
